# Python Variables
# Variables are created, when we assign a value in it
x = 5
y = 'Hello World!'

# Comments
# Comments start with a #, and Python will render/show the rest of the line as a comment:
#This is a comment

#Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:
print('Hello World!') #This is a comment

#Multiline Comments
#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#Example
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

#Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
